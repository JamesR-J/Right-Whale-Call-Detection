# Right-Whale-Call-Detection
Model to predict whether an audio sample contains a North Atlantic Right Whale call

talk about using kaggle dataset so had to preprocess cus in .aiff and that tf function uses wav
also since was doing this, wasn't hard to put files into folders so could use flow from direcotry rather than flow from dataframe, literally no reason just was easy
then say provided my processed dataset too for ease for some people, ie the processing took like 48hrs or something stupid

future plans:
maybe a way to detet diff whales like personal id
improve the model for further performance
try it for other whale call datasets, thers a minke one to look at
